# csv-reader-test
This application receives a CSV file, saves it in a SQLite database, and displays it in card format.

To run backend: /api --> npm run dev

To run frontend: /client --> npm run dev

Once it receives the CSV file, it creates a database.sqlite file in the api directory where it keeps the CSV file data.
